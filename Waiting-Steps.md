In some scenarios, your page may have JavaScript animations or some other page load that the browser otherwise considers ready.

While the above method introduces the most flexibility, a simpler set of steps also exist. These setups can check for an element to be displayed, not displayed, exist or not exist and optionally wait a given number of seconds for that to happen. This can be useful for scenarios where a wait dialog has appeared and you don't wish to perform further work until it has cleared. It also implicitly sets performance benchmarks. The commands are listed below with the (for \<seconds\> seconds) as optional.
